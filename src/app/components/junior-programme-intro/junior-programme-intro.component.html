<h1>Junior Programme</h1>

<p>
The Boroughbridge & District Angling Club has embarked on an exciting initiative by partnering with The Angling Trust to develop coaching days for junior anglers. This collaborative effort aims to provide opportunities for both new and more experienced young anglers to enhance their skills and passion for the sport. With a team of qualified coaches and dedicated volunteers, the programme caters to junior anglers between the ages of 8 and 18.

The coaching days organised by the club and The Angling Trust offer a structured, safe and supportive environment for young anglers to learn and develop their fishing techniques. The qualified coaches bring their expertise and experience to guide the junior anglers, ensuring they receive proper instruction and guidance. These coaches not only teach the technical aspects of angling but also in-still a sense of sportsmanship and respect for the environment.

One of the key components of the program is the organisation of competitions and matches. These events provide an opportunity for junior anglers to showcase their skills and compete against their peers. Competitions not only encourage healthy competition but also foster camaraderie and a sense of community among the young anglers. It is through these events that junior anglers can gain valuable experience, learn from their fellow anglers, and build lasting friendships.

In addition to local competitions, the program also includes trips away. These outings give junior anglers the chance to explore different fishing locations and experience a variety of fishing conditions. Trips away provide a unique learning opportunity as junior anglers can encounter new species of fish and adapt their techniques accordingly. These experiences broaden their knowledge and understanding of angling, promoting personal growth and development.

Overall, the coaching days offered by the Boroughbridge & District Angling Club and The Angling Trust provide junior anglers with a structured and supportive environment to learn, compete, and grow. Through the guidance of qualified coaches and the camaraderie among fellow anglers, young participants have the opportunity to develop their skills, build lasting connections, and cultivate a lifelong passion for angling. This collaboration serves as a model for other angling clubs and organisations to invest in the development of young talent and secure the future of the sport.
